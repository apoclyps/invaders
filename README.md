# Invaders

Invaders is an open source terminal arcade game with audio, based off of the "Space Invaders" classic arcade game.

This game was implemented as part of an example project for the [Ultimate Rust Crash Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-rust-crash-course/?referralCode=AF30FAD8C6CCCC2C94F0).
